### hipster-batch

#### A Seek hackathon project for 13th of June, 2015

I wanted to learn Clojure and finally had an oportunity to. So this is a primitive implementation of the 
reader client for the ['hipster-batch'](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/hipster-batch) process 
for inter-team data transfer. 

Obvious disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm doing

**Requires: **
* Leiningen
* s3 bucket access

**Usage**

    lein run #Kicks off polling process
